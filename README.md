## Machine-Learning-With-Python-Coursera-Week-6-Project
Over the course of 5 weeks of Machine Learning with Python IBM, we were equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms. In this peer graded project of week 6, we had to load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and build classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. The results were reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoass.
